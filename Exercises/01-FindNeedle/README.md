## Introduction
Find the index of the first occurrence of a string (needle) within another (haystack).

That is, the goal of the exercise is to determine if the first string, needle, is inside the second, haystack, and if so, to return the index at which this occurs.

### Examples
###### Finds it
**needle**: redux       
**haystack**: react-redux        
**output**: 6       

###### Can't find it
**needle**: puntual           
**haystack**: pinky          
**output**: -1             

In this case, since the needle is not in the haystack, the output value is -1.

#### IMPORTANT
To solve this exercise you cannot use the pre-existing function: <b>strpos(), array_search( )</b> or similar
