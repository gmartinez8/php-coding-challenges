# Multi-Dimensional SumArray
## Introducci√≥n
We already work with one-dimensional arrays, now we will go up a notch and go through two-dimensional arrays, that is, an array of integer arrays.

In this case, the goal is to find the sum of all the elements of the array.

### Example
```
arr=[1,2,3,4]
```
**output**:  10

```
arr=[ [2,4] , [1], [4,2,1] ]
```
**output**:  14


**Function Description**

md_array_sum  has the following paramter(s):

`arr[n]`: an array of integers

**Returns**

`int`: sum total


**Sample Input**

```
[ 2, [3,4], 5, [-3, [6 , [ 4,5 ] ] ] ]
```

**Sample Output**
```
26
```
